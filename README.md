 # random bedtime wind-down

This repository will host the web UI code for the **random bedtime wind-down** tool.

## Project idea

- A small web app to help you relax before sleep, e.g. by:
  - Generating random gentle prompts or activities
  - Playing calming text, stories, or routines
  - Providing a simple nightly checklist or wind-down flow

## Tech stack (to be decided)

You can use any front-end stack you like, for example:

- Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- React / Vue / Svelte
- A Vite-based SPA

## Getting started

1. Add your front-end code under a structure like:
   - `public/` – static assets (icons, images, etc.)
   - `src/` – application source
2. Configure your build tool (if any) to output to `dist/` or `build/`.
3. Optionally connect this repo to GitHub and set up deployment (e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
